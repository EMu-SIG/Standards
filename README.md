# EMu-Standards-Definitions
A repository for storing Standards Definitions created by an institution.

To allow definitions to be easily found, when adding a new definition please:
1. Add a Top Level directory naming the Standard if one does not already exist.
2. Create a second level directory naming your institution if one does not already exist. You may decide to use your full institution name or EMu acronym e.g. Field Museum of Natural History or FMNH
3. Add the standard definition into your directory

```

When searching for a Standard to import as a starting point for your definitions you should ideally look for an institution which has a similar schema to yours in order to minimize the number of columns which will require updating.   

To export a standard for uploading to this repository please refer to the Scheduled Exports (https://help.emu.axiell.com/latest/en/Topics/Common/Scheduled%20Exports.htm)  documentation in the EMu Help.
